OriginalMemoryCardGame.py = Functioning attempt with clunkier code and a few errors that need to be fixed

MemoryCardGame.py = Final Version

When our group was figuring out a program idea that we could use linked lists, queues, and stacks in we could not find a very good example program that utilized all three in an effective way.
This resulted in us starting out trying to wedge linked lists, stacks and queue into one program that really did not benefit from  their usage.
That can be seen starting to form in the OriginalMemoryCardGame.py file.
The final iteration of this program was us each working on our own versions of the memory card game that we discussed and planned on implementing using linked lists. 

I decided to focus on the more important concept of linked lists as our group discussed this lab in class and this seemed to be the more important concept to get right as it is more complex than a stack or queue.
This decision allowed the program to be less forced into not ideal data types. Allowing for easier usage of the linked lists and organization of data.
If I were to do this program without the constraint of a linked list the code would probably be less memory intensive, more purpose built and more concise.

Instructions for how to play the game are given in the IDE terminal when you run the program in an IDE. For a cheat sheet of the back end linked list uncomment the #deck.printLL() on line 96.
The users input has safeguards in place so as to not crash the program from an out of bound index or a word where a number was asked for.

This program is uses a few basic building blocks form geeks for geeks for the linked list implementation most of which was modified to be purpose build for this program.
Also used some ChatGPT to figure out python syntax, and examples of usage for specific tasks.
